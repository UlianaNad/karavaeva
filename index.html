                    I was born in Kiev, Ukraine and I was very active child – I love sports. 
                    At the age of 13 I joined fitness class.I quickly became interested learning everything I could about nutrition.  I tested many diets, especially those that were scientifically proven. I should say it was not so easy for me to change my food habits completely.  I was practicing yoga for several years. I even tried vegetarian diet.  I learned to stay disciplined, determined and goal minded. As a result of my determination, felt healthier, energized, happy and inspired to reach higher goals and standards for myself. 
                    In 2006 I began lifting serious weights and with assistance of yoga, and nutritionally rich meals, I noticed how my body began to change fast. I concentrated on better understanding how protein functions in the body and the effects of proper diet application. I became an expert.
                    Despite challenges in live, such us destroyed marriage followed by depression and other general complications associated with living in poor country, I remained motivated and goal oriented. Workouts at the gym kept me focused on my goals.

                                So this is me around a year ago on the left. My weight is about 230 lbs. I've maintained this super unhealthy weight for about two years and couldn’t really do much about it. I lived and Europe and ate unhealthy, irregular and junk.
                                I think it was around February when I met my amazing trainer- Olga.
                                This day changed my life to the better and believe it or not I hate writing reviews orcomments but this is a life miracle
                                . This is me on the right today. My weight is 206lbs and this is definitely not the end result. I didn't workout constantly because of my work schedule and chaotic life moments, but this is where we are now. Do I feel better? Yes! Do I want to lose more and gain more myself? Hell Yeah! This is not even a mid point but I am very happy! Olga is a great trainer and a life coach. She is always there for me. she helped me to be present in the moment and most importantly she motivated me to believe in myself! I am thankful for this meeting and after seeing results, I want to get better and better. Hold me accountable guys!
